            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Data Architects spend most of their day in modern, well-equipped offices on their computers analysing
                information. They may also have to attend inquiry calls from clients.
                As a Data Architect, you may need to travel to attend meetings, conduct presentations or training
                sessions, or set up and manage databases.
            </p> <br>

            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Data Architects generally work regular business hours from 9 am to 5 pm and may put in more than 40
                hours a week. Their schedules may vary depending on deadlines. If you are working on a freelance
                assignment, you may have the freedom to establish your work days and hours.
            </p> <br>

            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Finding a new job might seem challenging. Data Architects can boost their job search by asking their
                network for referrals, contacting companies directly, using job search platforms, going to job fairs,
                leveraging social media, and inquiring at staffing agencies.

                <li>Any academic program that a potential Data Architect takes up typically requires a period of
                    supervised experience, such as an internship. You may undertake internships in IT fields under the
                    supervision of experienced Data Architects that enable you to master application architecture,
                    network management, and performance management. Experience is particularly valuable since data
                    architecture typically does not offer entry-level jobs. </li>

                uses. To stay abreast with evolving technology, you may consider taking in-person or online
                <strong>courses in
                    data modelling techniques, data warehousing, ETL (extract, transform, load) tools, SQL (Structured
                    Query
                    Language), databases or data administration. </strong> Equipping yourself with professional
                certifications offered
                by companies such as IBM, Salesforce and Hortonworks will lend you a competitive edge in the job market.
