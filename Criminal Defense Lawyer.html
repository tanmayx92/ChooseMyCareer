        <div>
            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p">Criminal Defense Lawyers work mostly in offices. But they frequently meet with clients outside
                their office at the courthouse, prisons, hospitals, and other venues. Some cases might need them to
                visit witnesses at hospitals or their homes. Most Criminal Defense Lawyers maintain a local practice.
                Those with a national practice need to travel frequently.
                <br>
                There was a time when lawyers would never wear anything but suits. Now, some firms allow business casual
                clothing for casual meetings with clients or colleagues. For the most part, Criminal Defense Lawyers
                wear tailored suits or formal dresses.
            </p>

            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">Criminal Defense Lawyers have no set work plan. Their daily schedule varies with the current
                workload and specifics of the case they are working on. Most of them work full time, and many work more
                than 40 hours per week.
                <br>
                Lawyers in private practice and those who work in large firms often work additional hours, conduct
                research, and prepare and review documents.
            </p>


            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                <strong> Most Criminal Defense Lawyers work in private practice or a solo firm. Some work for non-profit
                    agencies
                    or the government as public defenders</strong>. Temporary staffing firms place law school graduates,
                unable to
                find permanent positions, in short-term jobs, which let them chalk up practical experience.
            </p>
            <h5>Criminal Defense Lawyers are generally employed by:</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Law Firms</li>
                <li>Legal Departments of Multinational Companies</li>
                <li>Non-Profit Agencies</li>
                <li>Government Agencies</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Long and unconventional work hours; large volumes of work and heavy pressure during trials or when
                    trying to meet deadlines</li>
                <li> <strong>Clients may include dangerous and mentally unstable drug addicts, killers, or chronic
                        offenders leading to negative media coverage and public outcry </strong> </li>
                <li>The need to be discreet and street smart while dealing with clients inextricably linked with
                    notoriety and ill-will </li>
                <li>Working for solo firms requires a balance between practicing law and running a business</li>
                <li>The need to set aside personal prejudices and judgment, and take an objective and clinical approach
                    when dealing with clients</li>
                <li>The pressure to excel and stand out among equally talented colleagues in competitive law firms</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>The program typically includes practical experience and internships. Some programs include a
                    vocational component and pupillage, also known as the work-based learning component.
                    <br>
                    Formal part-time jobs or summer internships in law firms, government agencies, or corporate legal
                    departments can help law students choose their specialization and lead directly to a job after
                    graduation.
                </li>

                <li>Smaller firms, government agencies, and public-interest organizations may hire students as summer
                    associates after they complete their first year at law <strong> Only law students who have completed
                        their second year are eligible for summer associate programs at larger firms</strong></li>
                <li>While in law school, prospective criminal lawyers should take advantage of any available training
                    opportunities. <strong>Experience in mock trials and moot courts in law school develops oral
                        advocacy skills
                        and gain trial experience in a simulated setting</strong>. Attend legal industry events to make
                    contacts at
                    law firms and meet potential hiring partners or gain referrals.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Recommended Qualifications</h1>
            <p class="p">
                The traditional route to becoming a lawyer, in some countries, includes completing a five-year
                qualifying law degree (LLB) at university. You can take a one-year conversion course in case your
                undergraduate degree is in another subject. In other locations, Criminal Defence Lawyers must first
                complete a four-year bachelor’s degree and then obtain a three-year accredited law degree.
                <br>
                Law school admissions are highly selective, so applicants should try to complete a well-rounded
                undergraduate program with high <strong> Other admission requirements typically include meritorious Law
                    School Admission Test (LSAT or its equivalent) scores, undergraduate transcripts, work experience,
                    letters of recommendation, and personal interviews</strong> potential Criminal Defence Lawyer may
                benefit from
                classes in public speaking and government processes.
                <br>
                Criminal law classes typically cover core courses, specialized courses in criminal law, research and
                writing for criminal law, working with evidence, litigation strategies, and ethics in criminal law. Most
                programs also require students to fulfill writing, general ethics, and professional requirements.

            <h1>Projected Career Map</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Performance, experience, and the acquisition of professional qualifications drives career progression.
                <strong>Very few in-house Corporate Lawyers are hired directly out of law school. New hires usually
                    start as
                    associates and work on teams with more experienced seniors</strong>. They need to work their way up
                or lose their
                positions. Advancement usually comes as significant pay raises, a movement to better-known companies,
                and promotion to managerial positions such as Supervisory Attorney, Managing Attorney, General Counsel,
                or Chief Legal Officer.
                <br>
                <strong>Corporate Lawyers who have put in several years may be offered a partnership in and partial
                    ownership of
                    a firm</strong>. Those who do not advance within their firm may be forced to leave, a practice
                commonly known as
                “up or out.”
                <br>
                Proficient Corporate Lawyers may choose to go into solo practice or move to a large corporation’s legal
                department. They may then move across organizations in pursuit of top positions. Others move beyond
                corporate legal departments to become CEOs or corporate board members. Some Corporate Lawyers become
                judges or law professors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Beneficial Professional Development</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Continuing professional development (CPD) is the holistic commitment of Corporate Lawyers towards
                enhancing personal skills and proficiency throughout their active careers through work-based learning, a
                professional activity, or formal education.
                <br>
                <strong>Corporate Lawyers need to participate in continuing legal education programs periodically, for
                    example,
                    either every year or every three years</strong>. Many law schools and bar associations provide
                courses to help
                members keep up with recent developments that may affect their practices.
                <br>
                Courses vary by location and generally cover a subject within the practice of law, such as legal ethics,
                taxes and tax fraud, and healthcare. <strong>Some locations allow lawyers to take continuing education
                    credits
                    through online courses</strong>. A few courses in business administration can improve employability.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="p">
                One Corporate Lawyer remarked that they liked this side of the law precisely because the transactions
                take place among peers: there is no wronged party, no underdog, and usually no inequity in the financial
                means of the participants.
            </p>
            <h5>Advice from the Wise</h5>
            <p class="p">
                If you are joining an established firm, determine quickly who your ‘trusted associate’ should be. They
                will be your best asset if you have a difficult time with an assignment or have questions that you are
                too embarrassed to ask your supervising partner.
