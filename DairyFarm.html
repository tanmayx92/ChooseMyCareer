        <div>
            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p">Working outdoors in various weather conditions and extreme temperatures is common practice
                amongst Dairy Farmers. They spend the better part of their workday on site, although they may need to
                travel to the offices of other stakeholders such as dairy producers, contractors, dealers, and
                engineers.
                <br>
                Their work necessitates that they frequently come in contact with large animals, making protective
                equipment and adherence to safety rules a must in the workplace.
            </p>

            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">Dairy Farmers generally work more than eight to ten hours a day and on nights and weekends.
                Their workday may frequently start before dawn.
            </p>


            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Finding a new job might seem challenging. Dairy Farmers can boost their job search by asking their
                network for referrals, contacting employers directly, using job search platforms, going to job fairs,
                and leveraging social media. Self-employment is a viable option.
            </p>
            <h5>Dairy Farmers are generally employed by:</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Large Corporate Companies</li>
                <li>Small Dairy Producers</li>
                <li>Dairy Cooperatives</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Working outdoors regardless of extreme temperatures and weather conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Dealing with large animals can be threatening to personal safety</strong> </li>
                <li>Having to work odd hours like nights and weekends can get frustrating</li>
                <li>Waking up to begin work before dawn each day may get tiring and lead to a lack of social life</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>Direct, hands-on, practical experience dealing with dairy cows is crucial. You will gain optimal
                    benefit from your tasks outside of the classroom when they line up perfectly with your lessons
                    inside it. You may get to hear countless stories from more experienced professionals and obtain
                    valuable hands-on experience when they manage to turn seemingly routine incidents into unique
                    learning moments.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Recommended Qualifications</h1>
            <p class="p"><strong>>Dairy Farmers generally require a two- or four-year degree in dairy science,
                    agriculture, or
                    animal science</strong> Such courses should typically cover a range of subjects such as dairy
                science, anatomy,
                physiology, reproduction, crop science, farm management, technology, and agricultural marketing.
                <br>
                High School students interested in pursuing careers in the dairy farming industry would find
                mathematics, accounting, agricultural science, digital technology, and biology helpful.
            </p>

            <h5>Certifications, Licenses and Registration</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Certification demonstrates a Dairy Farmer’s competence in a skill set, typically through work
                experience, training, and passing an examination.
                <br>
                Voluntary <strong>certification from an objective and reputed organisation in animal resources, dairy
                    cattle
                    nutrition, animal nutrition, animal genetics, or animal welfare science can help you stand out in a
                    competitive job market</strong> and increase your chances of advancement.
                <br>
                <strong> Dairy Farmers typically need to have a valid driver’s license</strong>. Typically, licensure
                requires an
                application, processing fees, an examination, and relevant education and experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Projected Career Map</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Performance, experience, and the acquisition of professional qualifications drive the career progression
                of Dairy farmers who can choose to go down diverse career paths.

                <strong>Those with a degree in veterinary or agriculture may become Farm Managers or Head
                    Veterinarians.</strong>
                <br>
                Dairy Farmers who own their business can expand the operation to increase their profits. Hired hands
                working on the farm may become Farm Managers or start their own dairy farming business.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Beneficial Professional Development</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Continuing professional development (CPD) will help an active Dairy Farmer build personal skills and
                proficiency through work-based learning, a professional activity, formal education, or self-directed
                learning.
                <br>
                Working professionals may study to gain additional business management qualifications or attend farming
                discussion groups to improve their work.
                <br>
                CPD is necessary for the regular renewal of essential certifications and licenses. It allows you to
                upskill continually, regardless of your age, job, or level of knowledge.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="p">
                By dint of the strength of their back and the sweat on their brow, Dairy Farmers overcome enormous and
                arduous challenges to ensure the majority of the global population doesn’t miss out on an essential
                component of their daily diet.
                <br>
                Like the products they supply, their vital contribution to the world often goes unremarked but is never
                forgotten.
