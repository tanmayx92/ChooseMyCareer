                for extended periods. You would likely collaborate with colleagues in the information technology
                department, such as network administrators or computer systems analysts. If you also work as a
                consultant, your tasks may mandate occasional travel to meet clients.</h5>
            <p class="p">Computer Security Specialists typically work 35 to 40 hours per week, Monday to Friday. Each
                project and the nature of work would determine any overtime required. Shift work may include evenings,
                nights and weekends. </p>

                asking their network for referrals, contacting companies directly, using job search platforms, going to
                job fairs, leveraging social media, and inquiring at staffing agencies.

            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Making sure to provide efficient protection to all computers through a well-designed and secure
                    network even if the work tends to be monotonous, repetitious and stressful with daily and weekly
                    deadlines to meet

                </li>
                <li>Dealing tactfully and patiently with clients highly frustrated with malfunctioning computers</li>
                <li>Tackling decision-making that has an impact on employees

                </li>
                <li> <strong> Sitting for long periods, which can give rise to health complaints</strong> </li>
                <li> <strong>Tackling the risk of losing data and inviting security threats while implementing cloud
                        computing</strong> </li>

        <div>
            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>Computer Security Specialists typically have <strong>
                        professional pre-entry work experience such as an
                        internship or a job in an information technology department as a network or computer systems
                        administrator.
                    </strong> <br>

                    However, some employers look more specifically for experience in a similar field to which they are
                    hiring. For instance, an opening in database security may need experience as a database
                    administrator. </li>

                <li>Certain graduate schemes and internships do not require pre-entry experience but may provide limited
                    opportunities. Employers may instead look for an evident passion for and an understanding of the
                    cyber and information security field. </li>

                <li>Networking with those in the industry and attending cyber and information security events helps open
                    doors for experience and jobs.</li>

                <li> Read about the profession and interview/job shadow experts working as Computer Security Specialists
                    to prove your commitment to course providers and prospective employers. (customise this sentence to
                    your current write-up).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

                relevant
                certifications that your employers specify. Also keep in mind larger organisations and financial
                services usually offer greater scope for progress. </p>

            <h5>Advice from the Wise</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Working in a cybersecurity position, you are likely to be well-paid. Hence, make your interests and not

            <p class="p">Think about what aspect of your work truly motivates you, and select a job that cashes in on
                your strengths and one that you love doing day after day. </p>
