        <div>
            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p">An Agronomist works under the overall supervision of the Senior or Chief Agronomist or
                Agricultural Scientist. The work is both varied and dynamic and has little in common with a normal
                office routine.
                <br>
                <strong> Agronomists have the advantage of being able to spend much of their time outdoors, except
                    during
                    inclement weather. A large part of an Agronomist’s work is done outside, in the open fields,
                    consulting
                    with farmers, or conducting research on plants and animals.</strong> They also spend time writing
                reports in
                offices or studying and carrying out research in testing laboratories. Some Agronomists may be required
                to travel.
                <br>
                The dress code of an Agronomist depends on the location and sector. A business casual attire is
                recommended for work at the office. Work in the fields and laboratory would require clothing specified
                for those settings.
            </p>

            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">Agronomist working hours may vary depending on the type of work but generally tend to be more
                regular for laboratory-based work. Seasonality is a significant factor in the job of an Agronomist, with
                work out in the fields mostly tending to take place in a specific period of the year. Therefore, a
                higher degree of flexibility is required when working out in the fields or directly running a business.
                Changes in weather conditions, production demands, or duration of the contract may dictate the working
                hours, and you may end up working more than 40 hours per week.
            </p>


            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Agronomists can become independent consultants for farmers and small businesses. They can also apply
                their knowledge in their farming practices. Agronomists with advanced studies can become professors in
                agricultural colleges. College placement offices and government employment offices can offer job
                placement assistance.
            </p>
            <h5>Agricultural Chemists are generally employed by:</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Medium to Large-Scale Farms</li>
                <li>Crop & Seed Production Companies</li>
                <li>Fertilizer Manufacturing Companies</li>
                <li>Environmental Organizations</li>
                <li>Agricultural Land-Maintenance Companies</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Gaining entry into the field requires extensive skill, knowledge, and experience</li>
                <li>Long working hours spent in the open areas in all sorts of weather conditions or the testing lab.
                </li>

            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>
                    You will need a considerable amount of skill, knowledge, and experience to be an Agronomist.
                    Usually, you will be required to have two-four years of prior work experience in a related field.
                    <strong> Experience in farming or conservation work, even on a part-time or seasonal basis, is a
                        significant
                        advantage.</strong>
                </li>


            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Recommended Qualifications</h1>
            <p class="p">An accredited technical <strong>diploma or bachelor’s or master’s degree in agricultural
                    science,
                    environmental science, food science and technology, agricultural biotechnology, veterinary science,
                    Agronomy and crop science, agroecology and sustainable agriculture, viticulture and enology, or
                    plant
                    sciences is required to become an Agronomist</strong>.
                <br>
                The areas covered by a student Agronomist include agrarian sciences, animal husbandry, forestry science,
                plant genetics, meteorology, phytopathology, botany, chemistry, biochemistry, hydraulics, rural
                appraisal procedures, agricultural buildings as well as agricultural law. Generally, employers are
                looking for candidates who have a PhD.
            </p>

            <h5>Certifications, Licenses and Registration</h5>
            <p>Agronomists can get certifications from authorized professional organizations that recognize expertise in
                agricultural and food science. Depending on the law applicable in the country where they are based, an
                Agronomist may need to be licensed by a specific professional body.
                <br>
                Successful certification programs serve and protect the public welfare by investigating individuals that
                practice outside of the program’s Code of Ethics. They help a profession secure its future by earning
                trust and respect.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Projected Career Map</h1>
            <p class="p">
                An Agronomist with strong technical knowledge and planning skills may initially progress from a
                consultancy role to a management position, such as Production Manager, and from there on to running a
                whole farm, nursery, or livestock holding.
                <br>
                An alternative career route for an Agronomist might involve specializing - for example, in improving and
                developing agricultural processes and practices such as sowing, planting, harvesting, and irrigation.
                They may focus on sustainable development and organic farming or helping farmers and livestock breeders
                to develop techniques and methods that are both profitable and environmentally sustainable.
                <br>
                An Agronomist might become a Research Scientist, studying productivity, crop genetics, storage methods,
                or strategies for agri-food products. They may branch out into environmental protection, soil
                conservation methods, and comb desertification, soil erosion, and pollution.
                <br>
                An Agronomist may choose to become a Technical Sales Representative and pursue a career in agricultural
                marketing and sales.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Beneficial Professional Development</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Agronomists may need some on-the-job training; however, it is generally assumed that you already have
                the necessary skills and work experience to perform the job.
                <br>
                As an Agronomist, you may also be required to <strong>know how to use certain analytical or scientific
                    software,
                    computer-aided design (CAD) software, and analytical or scientific software tools </strong> such as
                3dMapper,
                Autodesk AutoCAD (Automatic Computer-Aided Design) software
                <br>
                <strong>A postgraduate qualification in crop science and management, animal technology, or agricultural
                    technology would prove advantageous in career advancement</strong>. You may decide you would like to
                teach
                agriculture or a related topic to complete a teaching qualification. It is also possible that an
                Agronomist takes postgraduate courses to move into a different area such as journalism, marketing, or
                business consulting. <strong>In addition to agricultural knowledge, Agronomists in top management
                    positions need
                    to have business analysis, financial planning, and accounting skills.</strong>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="p">
                <strong>Working with and for the environment is one of the principal reasons you would choose to embark
                    on a
                    career as an Agronomist</strong>...if conservation of natural resources goes wrong, nothing else

            <p class="p">
                Ease and security - are these the drugs that ease the constant challenge of the minds of men? Do
                nations, like men, become lethargic when well-fed and bodily comfortable? The global food security
                challenge is so big and so complicated that it cannot be solved by one category of organization.
