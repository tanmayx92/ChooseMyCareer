            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p">Civil Rights Lawyers spend the better part of their workday in their office, reading,
                researching, documenting findings, and drafting legal documents. You may research by sifting through
                computer databases, browsing the internet, or perusing books from a library. During trials, Civil Rights
                Lawyers must be present at court.
            </p>

            <p class="p">A Civil Rights Lawyer must <strong>occasionally travel to meet with clients at various
                    locations</strong>, such
                as homes, hospitals, or prisons, to collect evidence or facts that will help them guard the human rights
                of their clients. Some Civil Rights Attorneys may travel to appear in court as and when required. </p>


            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Civil Rights Lawyers typically work full time, although part-time or contractual work is also possible,
                even hourly. They put in at least 40 hours per week, constantly striving to meet case deadlines.
            </p>

            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Most Civil Rights Lawyers work in private practice, either in a law firm or solo practice. They may also
                work as full-time permanent employees or on a contractual basis for a fixed number of cases or duration.
                <br>
                Finding a new job might seem challenging. Civil Rights Lawyers can boost their job search by asking
                their network for referrals, contacting companies directly, using job search platforms, going to job
                fairs, leveraging social media, and inquiring at staffing agencies. Check law journals and newspaper ads
                for civil rights law vacancies.
            </p>
            <h5>Civil Rights Attorneys are generally employed by:</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Law Firms</li>
                <li>Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)</li>
                <li>Non-Profitable Organisations (NPOs)</li>
                <li>Charities</li>

                <li>Media Houses</li>

            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li> <strong> Meeting the expectations of clients, some of which may be unrealistic with regard to time
                        and desired outcomes </strong> </li>
                <li>The need for excellent problem-solving, oratory and research drafting skills </li>
                <li>Heavy pressure and long working hours to meet deadlines during trials; lack of work-life balance
                </li>
                <li>The highly competitive job market</li>
                <li>Finding a balance between the inadequate use of or over-dependence on technology</li>
                <li> <strong>Adapting to the constantly evolving legal guidelines</strong> </li>
                <li>Countering any negative perceptions that the public may hold</li>
                <li> <strong>The need for patience, stamina and skilful negotiation to take a case to its rightful
                        conclusion</strong> </li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>Any academic program that a potential Civil Rights Lawyer undertakes typically requires a period of
                    supervised experience, such as an internship or clinic. Law schools may mandate that you chalk up
                    experiential coursework tackling human rights issues through the academic year. </li>

                <li>You may find <strong> summer internships at law firms that take on human rights cases or at advocacy
                        organisations that support the victims of human rights abuse</strong> . You may also seek
                    volunteering
                    opportunities at organisations that specialise in human rights. The careers department at your
                    university is a valuable resource to guide you in the right direction.</li>

                <li> <strong>Engaging with humanitarian extracurricular activities and externships during summer breaks
                    </strong> under the
                    supervision of experienced Civil Rights Lawyers is helpful. Such programs teach you practical skills
                    in human rights law and help you network. They allow you to gain expertise in human rights law and
                    network with people you may work alongside later.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Recommended Qualifications</h1>
            <p class="p">Civil Rights Lawyers must earn their law degree, either an LLB (Bachelor of Laws) or a JD
                (Juris Doctor), depending on location. Either way, a bachelor’s degree is the first step to entering the
                profession. Law school entry is competitive and depends on multiple criteria, such as academic grades,
                standardised test scores, work experience, and interviews. Individual law schools mandate different
                admission criteria. </p>

            <p class="p">One pathway to becoming a Civil Rights Lawyer in some locations is to pursue <strong>an LLB
                    program
                    after graduating from high school and qualifying in the relevant aptitude test.</strong> The program
                teaches you
                the fundamentals of law and legal systems, preparing you for entry-level positions as Civil Rights
                Lawyers.
                <strong>Another alternative is to earn your bachelor’s degree in disciplines other than law and follow
                    it up
                    with a one-year graduate diploma in law or a professional examination.</strong> You would learn
                about the core
                components of the law and legal systems within a year. This pathway is informally known as law
                conversion.
            </p>

            <p class="p">Some Civil Rights Lawyers may choose to pursue further studies by acquiring a <strong> Master
                    of Laws
                    (LLM)</strong> degree, which enriches your academic knowledge of legal matters, including
                international human
                rights law. You may specialise in your particular interest and typically complete an internship as well.
                You may also opt for a <strong>Master of Arts (MA) degree in Human Rights</strong> , in which you
                examine human rights
                within the framework of anthropology, international relations, law, and political science.</p>

            <h5>Certifications, Licenses and Registration</h5>
            <p class="p">Certification demonstrates a Civil Rights Lawyer’s competence in a skill set, typically through
                work experience, training, and passing an examination. When acquired from an objective and reputed
                organisation, it can help you stand out in a competitive job market, carry a significant salary premium
                of up to 18 per cent, increase your chances of advancement, and allow you to become an independent
                consultant. Successful certification programs protect public welfare by incorporating a Code of Ethics.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Individual government entities conduct the licensing process. It typically requires the passage
                of an examination in addition to the fulfilment of eligibility requirements, such as a minimum level of
                education, work experience, training, or the completion of an internship, residency, or apprenticeship.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Depending on location, Civil Rights Lawyers take licensing examinations called bar
                examinations, typically after graduating from law school. The bar test is mandatory to practise as a
                lawyer in any jurisdiction and typically requires extensive preparation alongside academic commitments.
                On passing the bar test, you are admitted to the bar in that jurisdiction and become eligible to work as
                a Civil Rights Lawyer. </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Projected Career Map</h1>
            <p class="p">Performance, experience, and the acquisition of professional qualifications drive career
                progression. Employees with consistently high levels of performance may be eligible for promotion every
                two to three years. </p>

            <p class="p">In private practice, a Civil Rights Lawyer’s performance may be <strong>measured in whether the
                    targeted amount of work chargeable to clients has been achieved</strong> . Becoming the Head of
                Department in the
                enterprise would make you responsible for departmental staff and profits.

            </p>
            <p class="p">Starting as an associate, you would typically work in a team under senior colleagues. Civil
                Rights Lawyers <strong>assume more significant and independent responsibilities as they acquire
                    experience and
                    sharpen their technical legal skills, client-handling abilities and business development
                    know-how.</strong>
                Senior roles would require you to supervise junior colleagues.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Beneficial Professional Development</h1>
            <p class="p">Continuing professional development (CPD) will help an active Civil Rights Lawyer build
                personal skills and proficiency through work-based learning, a professional activity, formal education,
                or self-directed learning. It allows you to upskill continually, regardless of your age, job, or level
                of knowledge.</p>
            <p class="p">While specific courses and requirements may vary by location, Civil Rights Lawyers must
                typically engage with continuing legal education programs periodically. They may pursue either in-person
                or online courses in <strong>legal ethics, taxes & tax fraud, and legal matters related to
                    healthcare</strong>. You may
                find that your law school or bar association offers you courses to keep current with the latest
                legislative developments that may impact your practice. Keep in mind that <strong>business
                    administration
                    courses</strong> can sharpen your business acumen as well as enhance your marketability.</p>
            <br>

        <div>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="p">
                If you are passionate about civil rights, fairness and justice for all, being a Civil Rights Attorney
                would not only fulfil your ambitions and dreams but serve to protect and fulfil those of many others.
                Despite the numerous challenges of the career, it is rewarding to know that you are equipped with the
                knowledge, skills and experience to safeguard the rights of vulnerable civilians.

            <h5>Advice from the Wise</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Build thorough knowledge of how to file a legal appeal and present a case to a judge. Meticulously
                investigate the legal data. Be skilled in formulating legal briefs and negotiating settlements on legal
                terms. Remember that you will need to decipher and explain laws and rulings to your clients who may not
                be familiar with legal jargon.
