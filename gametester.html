            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p"> <strong>Game Testers are office-based, and most of their work is done sitting at a desk using
                    a computer.</strong>
                They work in teams consisting of other testers, developers, programmers, artists and designers. After
                the release of the game, they will collaborate with the customer support team too. More often than not,
                remote and overseas work are viable options.
            </p>


            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">Typically Game Testers work full-time for around 35 hours/week. However, strict deadlines often
                demand extended work hours. As the game nears completion, you may have to work overtime and take early
                morning, evening and weekend shifts. Freelancing and self-employed Game Testers will have more flexible
                work hours. </p>

            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                Finding a new job might seem challenging. Game Testers can boost their job search by asking their
                network for referrals, contacting companies directly, accessing job search platforms and specialist game
                publications, leveraging social media and inquiring at staffing agencies. Jobs can also be obtained on a
                short-term contract or freelance basis.

                    languages
                    such as Python and Java from an objective and reputed organisation can help you</strong> stand out
