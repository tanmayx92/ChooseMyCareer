            <h1>Standard Work Environment</h1>
            <p class="p"><strong>Corporate Lawyers work in a fast-paced work environment</strong>. They spend a part of
                their time in
                meetings with board members and management, helping them strategize and offering legal and business
                advice. They typically work in comfortable, well-lit offices. They often have their own spaces and
                secretaries assigned to them with access to legal research assistants and a library. <strong>Large
                    companies
                    also provide them with the latest technology and office equipment and a supporting team of
                    paralegals,
                    legal secretaries, and administrative professionals</strong>.
            </p>

            <h5>Work Schedule</h5>
            <p class="p">Work hours are typically 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., although some evening and weekend work may be
                required, especially when preparing court cases. Working less than 40 hours is unusual, and most
                Corporate Lawyers work considerably more. Those working in large firms tend to put in the most extended
                hours, as do those in private practice. </p>

            <h5>Employers</h5>
            <p class="p">
                <strong>Most Corporate Lawyers work in private practice, either in a law firm or a solo
                    practice</strong>. They may also
                work in-house as full-time employees of one company. Self-employed Corporate Lawyers may advise several
                corporate clients.
            </p>
            <h5>Corporate Lawyers are generally employed by:</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Private Corporations</li>
                <li>Government Agencies</li>
                <li>Judiciary</li>
                <li>Law Firms</li>
                <li>Educational Organizations</li>
                <li>Nonprofit Organizationsy</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Workplace Challenges</h5>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>Heavy pressure during work, especially to meet deadlines during trials</li>
                <li>An exercise in stamina and skillful negotiation as a deal moves towards closing time</li>
                <li>Demands of work limit personal interests and family life</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h1>Suggested Work Experience</h1>
            <ul class="noul">
                <li>Part-time jobs or summer internships in law firms, government agencies, and corporate legal
                    departments provide valuable experience. <strong>Smaller firms, government agencies, and
                        public-interest
                        organizations may hire as summer associates certain students who have completed their first year
                        at
                        law school. The summer associate programs in most large firms are open only to law students who
                        have
                        completed their second year.</strong></li>
                <li>Talking to seasoned Corporate Lawyers about their jobs and asking them what they like and dislike
                    about their careers, how they broke into the field, and other such questions will help students
                    learn more about this specialty. Students can seek help from their school counselors or a
                    professional association to arrange an interview. <strong>Typing briefs, working in the law school
                        library,
                        or searching records as a junior court clerk will give you job contacts and a firsthand view of
                        the
                        legal world.</strong></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h1>Recommended Qualifications</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Performance, experience, and the acquisition of professional qualifications drives career progression.
                <strong>Very few in-house Corporate Lawyers are hired directly out of law school. New hires usually
                    start as
                    associates and work on teams with more experienced seniors</strong>. They need to work their way up
                or lose their
                positions. Advancement usually comes as significant pay raises, a movement to better-known companies,
                and promotion to managerial positions such as Supervisory Attorney, Managing Attorney, General Counsel,
                or Chief Legal Officer.
                <br>
                <strong>Corporate Lawyers who have put in several years may be offered a partnership in and partial
                    ownership of
                    a firm</strong>. Those who do not advance within their firm may be forced to leave, a practice
                commonly known as
                “up or out.”
                <br>
                Proficient Corporate Lawyers may choose to go into solo practice or move to a large corporation’s legal
                department. They may then move across organizations in pursuit of top positions. Others move beyond
                corporate legal departments to become CEOs or corporate board members. Some Corporate Lawyers become
                judges or law professors.
            </p>

            <h5>Certifications, Licenses and Registration</h5>
            Criminal Defence Lawyers must pass the bar exam before practicing the law. Change of location would require
            passing a bar exam pertinent to the area. <strong>Some locations require a character evaluation and
                background test
                before granting you admission to the bar</strong>.

            Individual government entities conduct licensing. It typically requires the passage of an examination in
            addition to the fulfillment of eligibility requirements, such as a minimum level of education, work
            experience, training, or the completion of an internship, residency, or apprenticeship.

            Voluntary certification from an objective and reputed organization can help you gain professional
            credibility, encourage renewal, and become an independent consultant. Successful certification programs
            protect public welfare by incorporating a Code of Ethics. <strong>Investigation of members who practice
                outside the
                Code earns public trust and respect, which are the most critical elements in securing a professional’s
                future.
            </strong>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h1>Projected Career Map</h1>
            <p class="p">There is stiff competition for Criminal Defence Lawyer positions. <strong>Traditionally, a
                    Criminal
                    Defense Lawyer begins working as a junior associate either for a law firm or for a prosecutor or a
                    public defender</strong>. They can advance to Senior Associate positions at law firms or choose to
                become
                self-employed as solo practitioners. Being accepted as a partner in a law firm could be the pinnacle of
                their career.

                <strong>Criminal Defense Lawyers can also work as District Attorneys who are employed by and prosecute
                    cases on
                    behalf of the government</strong>. A few choose to work with non-profit organizations and represent
                individuals
                who cannot afford private counsel.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h1>Beneficial Professional Development</h1>
            <p class="p">Continuing professional development is the holistic commitment of professionals towards
                enhancing personal skills and proficiency throughout their active careers through work-based learning, a
                professional activity, formal education, or self-directed learning.

                Most locations require Criminal Defence Lawyers to meet continuing education requirements to stay
                up-to-date on developments in the legal fields and law changes. These courses may be taken through
                national and state bar associations, law schools, or even the Internet.

                CPD allows individuals to upskill continually, regardless of their age, job, or level of knowledge. It
                prevents practical and academic qualifications from becoming outdated, enables individuals to identify
                any knowledge gaps, and allows professionals to progress to a new specialism.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="p">
                Law without justice is a wound without a cure. There isn’t much justice in this world. Perhaps that’s
                why Criminal Defence Lawyers find it immensely satisfying to create some as often as possible.
            </p>
            <h5>Advice from the Wise</h5>
            <p class="p">
                It is better to see ten guilty men walk free than one innocent man put in jail. So, although a Criminal
                Defence Lawyer has one of the more thankless jobs in the legal arena, you are there to ensure that the
                innocent get a fair trial.
